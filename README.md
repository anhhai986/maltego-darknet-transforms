> I love data and visualizing data!

[![Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/img/itds-single.jpg)](https://www.paterva.com/)

Maltego is an interactive data mining tool that renders directed graphs for link analysis. The tool is used in online investigations for finding relationships between pieces of information from various sources located on the Internet.

Maltego uses the idea of transforms to automate the process of querying different data sources. This information is then displayed on a node based graph suited for performing link analysis.

> I hope you can use my local transforms and that you enjoy collecting data as much as i do :)
> Visualizing data or doing OSINT it all boils down to good sources and what you do with them!

## Local Transforms

Here is a more detailed version and directly links into each local transform that i have made so far and are all included in this "local transform distribution" that i call Maltego DarkNET Transforms :: MDNT.

> * **Our naming scheme is the following:** mdnt.{category}.{type}.{source}.{action}
> * **{type} possibilities:**
>   * **ext** - Lookup from external data sources
>   * **tor** - TOR information
>   * **net** - IP/Network information
>   * **www** - Crawling things on the interwebs :)

## Maltego versions

So we all know that Maltego offer 3 versions: XL, Classic and CE

The XL and Classic versions are very expensive but if you are in the OSINT industry then it's a small amount to pay for one of the worlds best OSINT or Data visualization tools there is. But never the less they also offer a CE version "Community Edition" that is free to use but with some restrictions and also they don't give you access to all of those very nice "transforms" that the big-boy club have access to.

This procject is a aim to give the CE guys something nice, also i don't mind who uses my transforms. If the XL og Classic users see use for them they are more than welcome to use them. The fact of the matter is i like parsing and crawling data, maltego gives me a way to visualize my passion and to play with OSINT :)

## Why PHP?

I have a great love hate relationship with PHP, so it's only natural for me to use it. I personally like the performance of PHP vs. things like Python or Perl. By this I mean things like what's available to you from the get-go, opcache and mem preformence, poxis threading and c++ modules if you need to implement even faster solutions. Also since my websites use PHP it's an easy integration and seemingness workflow to jump between backend and frontend if i ever want to make any of it into an UI etc.

## Outside contributions

I always welcome contributions from the outside. If you think I need to add a specific feature or you want to help me correct something that is wrong just mention it and I'll fix it right away. There is even the possibility that you could be added as a user on this repo. But for now it's only me.

## Donations

I thought about this and I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for, my idea with this project was to create a "semi" public approach to Maltego CE transforms.

You can donate Bitcoins or Ethereum to me for maintaining the project.

## References

When I find something online that I think I can use, implement or otherwise lean from when building my transforms I will paste it here. There is of course a couple of major references that keeps popping up again and again. These are listed below to.
